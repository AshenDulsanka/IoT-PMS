#  PUSL-2022 UpTime

The IoT project's mobile app we are creating for the second year Introduction to IoT (PUSL2022) module.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system for diesel generators using IoT technology. The system will collect sensor data from the diesel generator and use it to identify early signs of failure, allowing for preventive maintenance to be scheduled. This will help to reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs. The system will use a hybrid edgecloud architecture to process the data and generate predictions about the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the diesel generator's critical components. These predictions will be used to generate alerts for the maintenance team, so they can schedule preventive maintenance and avoid unplanned downtime.
